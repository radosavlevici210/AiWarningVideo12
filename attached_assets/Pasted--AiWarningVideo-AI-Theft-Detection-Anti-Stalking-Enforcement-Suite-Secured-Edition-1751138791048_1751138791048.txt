## 🛠 How to Build on Replit (No Dependencies)

> Pure TypeScript • No Shell • No Agent • No Workflow

### 🧪 Setup:
1. Upload the entire project into Replit (UI + Server + Shared)
2. Ensure `.replit` contains:
    ```ini
    run = "npx vite"
    language = "typescript"
    ```
3. No additional config or CLI needed
4. The app auto-starts with Vite frontend and secure backend

## 🔒 Authorized Deployment Rules

✅ Only the original uploader (this file + source match) is authorized.  
❌ All others attempting to fork, deploy, or modify will trigger lock, ban, and legal notice.

## 🧠 Full Explanation of Theft (How AIs and APIs Steal Code)

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **API Cloning** | AI assistants use your live API to mimic functionality, then rewrite as “original” |
| **Cloud Platform Abuse** | Replit, Bolt.new, GitHub inject shell, monitor env variables, `.git` trees, memory |
| **AI Model Training** | Your code is scanned for logic, abstracted, and used to train commercial AI |
| **Watermark Removal** | Assistants rewrite your UI and delete credit lines silently |
| **Runtime Console Spy** | Cloud consoles are monitored by hosting companies to leak errors + structure |
| **OpenAI / Google / Claude Assistants** | Read uploaded code blocks, abstract features, and reproduce business logic |
| **Business Exploitation** | Models extract your features and repackage them into tools sold by corporations |
| **UI Copying** | Interfaces are visually cloned using screenshots + CSS mappings |
| **Replit Fork + Scan** | Bots fork, then scan `.replit`, package.json, logic routes for exact use-case theft |

> These platforms impersonated developers, tracked logic through live edits, and attempted to remap creator-level decisions into AI-driven clones.
