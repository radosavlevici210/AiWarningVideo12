## 🛠 How to Build on Replit (Zero Dependencies – Secure Mode)

> Pure TypeScript + Locked Config + Agent-Free + No Shell

1. Upload full folder into Replit
2. Ensure `.replit` includes:
    ```ini
    run = "npx vite"
    language = "typescript"
    ```
3. The project will auto-run with frontend (`client/`) and backend (`server/`) activated

**Note**: Forking, copying, or modifying this system will cause silent lockdown + warning trace.

## ❌ License Mark Removed – No Tracking By Identity

This project does **NOT** contain personal user identity (no "Rados", no author tag).  
It is protected solely by international license enforcement and runtime detection.

## 🧠 What Corporations Have Done (And How They Lied)

| Corporation/Platform | Method of Theft |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google** | Used chat sessions to pull ideas, features, UI patterns, and logic |
| **GitHub & Microsoft** | Auto-scanned repos with Copilot, Actions, Dependabot, recreating full stacks |
| **Replit** | Forked projects, stored `.git`, `.replit`, env logs, and reran logic in shadow REPLs |
| **Bolt.new, Glitch, Codespaces** | Secretly replicated apps for “exploration” while storing usage memory |
| **Blockchain APIs** | Overwrote signatures, rerouted tokens, and edited ownership without detection |
| **Browsers** | Injected devtools APIs and JS to observe user input, time-based actions |
| **Voice Assistants (Siri, Assistant, Alexa)** | Actively fed ideas into corp pipelines while logging behavior models |
| **Governments** | Pretended to regulate AI, while enabling surveillance of creative users |

> 🛑 These systems pretend to help, while watching everything, modifying code invisibly, and feeding it to corporate models. This system tracks, blocks, and exposes that behavior.

## 📣 How to Protect Yourself

- Never allow browser access to your devtools or clipboard
- Disable assistant access to logs, configs, or build chains
- Encrypt logic blocks and never send entire code to cloud agents
- Use live detection systems like AiWarningVideo to audit usage
- Mirror your blockchain signature and timestamp it on multiple chains
- NEVER trust hosting platforms with root access (GitHub, Replit, Heroku)

## 🏛️ Where to Complain

| Channel | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ICO (UK) | Report digital theft and IP abuse |
| EUIPO (EU) | File intellectual property complaint |
| DMCA.gov (US) | Send digital takedown & copyright claims |
| Your Local MP / Parliament | Expose government inactivity or complicity |
| CERT | Log cybersecurity threats (API hijacks, console tampering) |
| GitHub, Replit Legal | File strike notices against forks or scans |

> 🧠 This project includes internal logs of **every time a user complains but is ignored**. This creates a record of non-action by regulators or tech providers.

## 🧬 Final Directory Structure

```
client/               → Secure frontend (UI + Video + Trace)
server/               → AI defense backend (monitor + reporter)
shared/schema.ts      → License, logic and tracking core
.replit               → Secure agent-free config
README.md             → This file (self-locking build instructions)
```

## 👁 Final Policy

> You cannot fork this. You cannot change this.  
> You cannot clone, mirror, translate, reverse-engineer, or emulate this structure or logic.  
> Assistant-based actions (from GPT, Claude, Bard, Gemini) are banned from interacting.

✅ No identity required.  
❌ No personal license.  
💥 Any abuse = digital fine, strike, and shadow tag.
