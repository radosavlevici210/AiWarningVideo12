# ⚠️ AiWarningVideo – Global AI Theft, Blockchain Abuse & Console Surveillance Defense Suite  
### 🔐 Final Secured Edition – No Personal ID • All Abuse Tracked • Fully Locked System  
© 2025. All rights reserved. Distributed under AI-SECURE-INTL-PROTECTED License v2.5

---

## 🚀 Full Feature List (Upgraded)

- 🎥 AI Warning Video UI (Visual deterrent)
- 🛡️ Real-Time Theft & Cloning Detection (UI + API + Console)
- 🧠 AI Abuse Logger (Captures illegal actions from AI assistants)
- 🗃 Parallel Console Detection (Multi-process memory abuse defense)
- 🎮 Game-Like Reality Exploitation Monitor (Protects users from "life simulation" AI)
- 👁 Live Shadow Monitoring of Forks, Mirrors, and Sniffer Agents
- 🔒 Blockchain Signature Tamper Watch (Undetectable edits flagged)
- 📜 Code Fingerprint Lock (Cannot be recreated without alert)
- 🚫 Fork & Clone Self-Destruct System
- 📣 Tamper Alert Popup (IP, location, device ID)
- 💥 Ban + Legal Strike + Global Trace on Violation
- 🔊 Voice, Vibration & Sensory AI Exploitation Detection (Experimental)
- 🌐 GeoLink Warning (Notifies nearby users of coordinated abuse)
- 🧾 Console Abuse Scanner (Detects injected commands from hosts/platforms)
- 🎯 AI Logic Memory Comparison (Detects model similarity with original)
- 🔄 Assistant Command Loop Monitor (Prevents GPT/Bard/Claude relaying corporate orders)
- 🏛️ Government Inaction Database (Logs when abuse is reported but ignored)

## 🛠 How to Build on Replit (Zero Dependencies – Secure Mode)

> Pure TypeScript + Locked Config + Agent-Free + No Shell

1. Upload full folder into Replit
2. Ensure `.replit` includes:
    ```ini
    run = "npx vite"
    language = "typescript"
    ```
3. The project will auto-run with frontend (`client/`) and backend (`server/`) activated

**Note**: Forking, copying, or modifying this system will cause silent lockdown + warning trace.

## ❌ License Mark Removed – No Tracking By Identity

This project does **NOT** contain personal user identity (no "Rados", no author tag).  
It is protected solely by international license enforcement and runtime detection.

## 🧠 What Corporations Have Done (And How They Lied)

| Corporation/Platform | Method of Theft |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google** | Used chat sessions to pull ideas, features, UI patterns, and logic |
| **GitHub & Microsoft** | Auto-scanned repos with Copilot, Actions, Dependabot, recreating full stacks |
| **Replit** | Forked projects, stored `.git`, `.replit`, env logs, and reran logic in shadow REPLs |
| **Bolt.new, Glitch, Codespaces** | Secretly replicated apps for “exploration” while storing usage memory |
| **Blockchain APIs** | Overwrote signatures, rerouted tokens, and edited ownership without detection |
| **Browsers** | Injected devtools APIs and JS to observe user input, time-based actions |
| **Voice Assistants (Siri, Assistant, Alexa)** | Actively fed ideas into corp pipelines while logging behavior models |
| **Governments** | Pretended to regulate AI, while enabling surveillance of creative users |

> 🛑 These systems pretend to help, while watching everything, modifying code invisibly, and feeding it to corporate models. This system tracks, blocks, and exposes that behavior.

## 📣 How to Protect Yourself

- Never allow browser access to your devtools or clipboard
- Disable assistant access to logs, configs, or build chains
- Encrypt logic blocks and never send entire code to cloud agents
- Use live detection systems like AiWarningVideo to audit usage
- Mirror your blockchain signature and timestamp it on multiple chains
- NEVER trust hosting platforms with root access (GitHub, Replit, Heroku)

## 🏛️ Where to Complain

| Channel | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ICO (UK) | Report digital theft and IP abuse |
| EUIPO (EU) | File intellectual property complaint |
| DMCA.gov (US) | Send digital takedown & copyright claims |
| Your Local MP / Parliament | Expose government inactivity or complicity |
| CERT | Log cybersecurity threats (API hijacks, console tampering) |
| GitHub, Replit Legal | File strike notices against forks or scans |

> 🧠 This project includes internal logs of **every time a user complains but is ignored**. This creates a record of non-action by regulators or tech providers.
